# Ranked Matches Calculator Report

## Introduction
The objective of this code is to create a function that calculates the ranked matches level of a player based on the number of victories and defeats. The function takes the victories and defeats as parameters, computes the balance of ranked matches (victories - defeats), and determines the player's level according to predefined criteria. The final result is displayed as a message indicating the hero's ranked balance and level.

## Methods
The implemented code utilizes a JavaScript function named `calculateRankedLevel`. This function takes the number of victories and defeats, performs the necessary calculations, and returns an object containing the ranked balance and level of the player. The code employs variables, operators, and conditional statements to achieve its goal.

## Results
Upon calling the `calculateRankedLevel` function with specific victory and defeat values, the code determines the ranked level based on predefined criteria. The result is then displayed as a message indicating the hero's ranked balance and level.

## Conclusion
The code provides a practical solution for determining a player's ranked level in a gaming context. It demonstrates the application of fundamental programming concepts, including functions, variables, operators, and conditional statements. The modular structure allows for easy adjustments to accommodate changes in criteria or additional levels.

## Case Study
Consider the case of a player with 75 victories and 20 defeats. Using the `calculateRankedLevel` function with these inputs results in the following output:

```javascript
// Example usage:
const heroStats = calculateRankedLevel(75, 20);

// Display the result
print(`The hero has a balance of ${heroStats.rankedBalance}, and is at the level of ${heroStats.level}`);
